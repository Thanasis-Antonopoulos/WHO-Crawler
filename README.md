# WHO-Crawler
This project crawls the official World Health Organization (WHO) website for information related to COVID-19. It extracts text data from relevant pages, preprocesses the data by tokenizing and filtering out stopwords, and then vectorizes the text using TF-IDF to analyze the most frequent and relevant terms.
